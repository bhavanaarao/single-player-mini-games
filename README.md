### Mini Games

**single-player-mini-games** is a collection of fun and engaging mini-games built with React. This app includes four classic games: Emoji Game, Rock Paper Scissors, Memory Matrix, and Card-Flip Memory Game. Each game has its own set of rules and unique gameplay to keep users entertained.

In the Home Route, users can see a list of all available games and start playing by clicking on the game cards. Each game has a detailed Game Rules View, a Game Playing View, and a Game Results View. The app ensures a seamless user experience with intuitive navigation and responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

This project leverages React components, React Router for navigation, and third-party libraries like React Modal and RC Progress to enhance the user interface and gameplay experience.
